##       Build a Tribute Page

* Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/NNvBQW/.

* Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

* Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries you need. Give it your own personal style.

* User Story: I can view a tribute page with an image and text.

* User Story: I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.

* Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.

* When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.

* You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
